# Quantum_Fourier_Transform
This repository contains an Isabelle/HOL theory (`QFT.thy`) in which a formalization of the quantum Fourier transform is made. The correctness of the algorithm is proved, together with its unitarity.

## Usage
We use [Isabelle2024](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/) for this project, which is built upon the [Isabelle_Marries_Dirac](https://github.com/AnthonyBordg/Isabelle_marries_Dirac?tab=readme-ov-file) quantum computing library.

In order run the theory `QFT.thy`, you must install the [Archive of Formal Proofs](https://www.isa-afp.org/) or, at least, the entry corresponding to the IMD library:

## AFP
This formalization is now part of the [Archive of Formal Proofs](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Quantum_Fourier_Transform.html) (Jan 28, 2025).
